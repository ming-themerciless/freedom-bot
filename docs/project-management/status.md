# Project status

Status date: 2026-08-13 (project reconciliation after §12.1 visual acceptance)

Baseline: v1.5; accepted by Peter Duscha on 2026-08-02

Overall health: Amber — Phases 0–2, the frontend visual-design track and the
Phase 3 readiness plan are accepted. P3.0 contract/security design is
authorized; production implementation has not begun and P3.1 remains blocked
behind P3.G0.

## Milestone status

| Milestone | State | Gate | Evidence / next condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 0 — Discovery and architecture | Accepted | Closed 2026-07-30 | `docs/discovery/phase-0-handoff.md`, `docs/review/phase-0-submission.md` |
| Phase 1 — Database foundation | Accepted | Closed 2026-07-31 | Maintainer acceptance at the head of `docs/review/phase-1-submission.md` |
| Phase 2 — Import and reconciliation | Accepted | Closed 2026-08-12 | C-24 and B-1 closed after independent re-review returned no findings; Peter Duscha accepted the data-integrity, identity and migration-safety gate. See `docs/review/phase-2-c-24-independent-re-review-2026-08-12.md` and change-log C-24-R. |
| §12.1 frontend visual-design track | Accepted | Closed 2026-08-13 | Peter accepted Steps 1–5, including real-mobile inspection. Fourteen frozen implementation/asset files verify against `docs/review/phase-3-visual-freeze-manifest.sha256`; current token and contrast tools pass. See `docs/review/phase-3-visual-prototype-handoff.md`. |
| Phase 3 — authentication, read-only portal and Council administration | P3.0 authorized | P3.G0 open | Peter accepted `docs/review/phase-3-delivery-plan.md` on 2026-08-13. Claude may prepare the contract/security design package only; P3.1 and Gemini production integration remain blocked pending Codex review and Peter's P3.G0 acceptance. |
| Phase 4 and later | Not ready | Predecessor gates apply | No later implementation is authorized. Follow implementation-plan §12.0 and package-specific definitions of ready. |

## Current critical path

1. **P3.0 contract/security design package.** Give Claude the accepted bounded
   handoff in `docs/review/phase-3-p3-0-claude-prompt.md`. P3.0 produces
   route/view-model/schema contracts
   and a threat model; it adds no protected route or framework scaffold.
2. **P3.G0 independent review and acceptance.** Codex reviews Claude's package;
   Peter accepts or remediates the contracts before implementation.
3. **Coordinated implementation prompts.** Claude owns the backend foundation;
   Gemini owns production Jinja/static/HTMX integration only against accepted
   route/view-model contracts; Codex supplies independent and separate
   security-focused review recommendations. Peter records gate decisions.
4. **Backend contract package.** Authentication and server-side authorization
   precede every protected route. The measured 9.57-second, 32-Actor preview
   requires a durable asynchronous/progressive design rather than a synchronous
   HTTP handler or restart-unsafe in-memory queue.
5. **Stop at the contract/security review.** Gemini production integration does
   not begin until Claude's route/view-model contracts are stable and accepted.

## Closed readiness inputs

- Project reconciliation and accepted visual baseline commit: completed
  2026-08-13 without production implementation.
- Phase 2 gate: accepted 2026-08-12.
- OD-16 and OD-17: closed 2026-08-12.
- Backend/frontend/review delivery-agent allocation: Claude/Gemini/Codex.
- §12.1 visual direction: accepted 2026-08-13.
- Visual implementation freeze: 14/14 manifest entries verified.
- Static evidence tools on 2026-08-13: CSS tokens 71 defined, 62 referenced,
  zero undefined; contrast self-tests 11 passed; contrast matrix 49 pairs, 48
  passed, one disabled-state exemption, zero failures.

## Open Phase 3 conditions

- maintainer/reviewer availability windows before calendar forecasting;
- confirmed development, disposable PostgreSQL and staging environments;
- expansion of the plan's traceability categories to exact test names during
  each implementation handoff;
- accepted backend route/view-model contracts before production frontend work;
  and
- updated configuration, deployment, monitoring and rollback plans for the new
  `freedom-web` process.

## Scope controls

- `design-prototype/` remains static reference material and must not be imported
  or served by production code.
- Phase 3 remains read-only for character game state. Council character-link
  management and snapshot-import control are authorized administrative flows;
  generic character corrections and controlled-vocabulary editors remain with
  their owning later typed packages.
- The former Claude contrast-tooling prompt is superseded without execution. It
  is not a backend implementation prompt.
- No deployment, Caddy change, OAuth registration, production database change,
  Foundry mutation or Google Sheet mutation is authorized by reconciliation.

## Historical evidence

The detailed Phase 2 remediation chronology remains in the dated records under
`docs/review/`, `docs/operations/` and `docs/project-management/change-log.md`.
This current-status document intentionally does not repeat superseded open-gate
statements; Git history retains the earlier status narrative.

## Next status update

Update when the Phase 3 delivery plan is submitted for readiness review, or
earlier if a new decision, critical risk or environment constraint emerges.
