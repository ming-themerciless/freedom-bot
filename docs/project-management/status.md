# Project status

Status date: 2026-08-15 (N-23's worker lease corrected to an exact 60 seconds and the lease/heartbeat ordering question withdrawn; exact built-in `int` required at every register gate; the five I-10 settings types made valid by construction; I-09 and I-10 amended; P3.G1 open)

Update 2026-08-15 (seventh, later the same day) — appended, not rewritten. This
one **corrects a claim made in the sixth update below**, which independent review
found wrong. Submitted in
[`../review/phase-3-p3-1-n-23-exact-lease-remediation-submission.md`](../review/phase-3-p3-1-n-23-exact-lease-remediation-submission.md).

- **N-23's worker lease is a value, not a ceiling.** The settings-construction
  remediation defined `lease_seconds` as `PolicyBound(minimum=1, maximum=60)`,
  which accepted every exact integer from 1 to 60 as a lease. The accepted row
  states `60 seconds, heartbeat at most every 20 seconds` — one sentence, a lease
  **value** and a heartbeat **maximum** — and SM-05's
  `lease_expires_at = now() + 60s`, the logical schema's claim and renewal
  statements and the operational contract's `N-23 + N-44` recovery bound all read
  it as a fixed 60. A one-second lease was therefore a contradiction of the
  accepted documents, not a permitted tightening, and would have lost a live
  claim to ordinary heartbeat scheduling. The runtime entry is now
  `PolicyBound(minimum=60, maximum=60, policy="N-23")`; `heartbeat_seconds` is
  **unchanged** at 1…20.
- **The lease/heartbeat ordering question recorded below is withdrawn, not
  answered.** `lease_seconds=1, heartbeat_seconds=20` was cited as an
  in-register configuration proving an ordering rule was missing. It was never in
  the register — it was in the implementation. With the lease exactly 60 every
  accepted heartbeat is already far inside it, so **no ordering rule was added
  and none is needed**, **no relationship involving N-45 has been accepted**, and
  **nothing about N-23 blocks P3.3.** What P3.3 still owns is the *consumer*
  evidence for the worker's lease, heartbeat, attempt, timeout and queue bounds.

Evidence is TC-STRUCT-07 and TC-LIM-06 as corrected, with 20 further cases in
`tests/web/test_settings_construction_validation.py` (165 total, up from 145);
607 portal and 2260 bot tests with no skips; `alembic check` clean; the visual
freeze intact; and a falsification run restoring only the `1…60` entry in memory,
in which 10 of the new cases fail while every other portal test stays green and
`git status --short` is identical before and after.

**Nothing is accepted by this correction.** No accepted numeric value moved —
N-23's lease was and remains 60 seconds — no configuration variable was added,
renamed or removed, `.env.example` is unchanged (it already shipped
`WORKER_LEASE_SECONDS=60`), and no state machine, schema, migration, route,
service, worker behaviour or deployment topology changed. **I-09 and I-10 both
remain open**, **P3.G1 remains open**, and **P3.2 and P3.3 have not started.**
The other residuals stated below are unchanged and still stand:
`WEB_WEBAUTHN_USER_VERIFICATION` and `WEB_RECOVERY_GRANT_MINUTES` are validated
but read by no runtime consumer, N-09/N-10 have no P3.1 route consumer, N-21/N-22
have no consumer at all, and the worker's lease/heartbeat/attempt consumers are
P3.3's.

Update 2026-08-15 (sixth, later the same day) — appended, not rewritten. Two
connected corrections, submitted together in
[`../review/phase-3-p3-1-settings-construction-validation-remediation-submission.md`](../review/phase-3-p3-1-settings-construction-validation-remediation-submission.md).

- **The session validator did not require an exact `int` (I-09, sixth amendment).**
  The fifth remediation made both gates share one definition, and that
  definition still said `isinstance(value, int) and not isinstance(value, bool)`.
  That refuses `bool` and every float and accepts **every other subclass of
  `int`** — and an `int` subclass may override its rich comparisons, which
  Python consults in preference to the left operand's when the right-hand type
  is a subclass. `dataclasses.replace(settings, max_sessions_per_account=LyingInt(10))`
  therefore survived construction *and* `SessionPolicy.derive()`, and
  `len(live) >= maximum` was false for every live-session count: **N-66
  inoperative for the third time**, through the supported public constructor.
  The accepted rule is now the exact built-in type, `type(value) is int`.
- **The five I-10 settings types are now valid by construction (I-10).**
  `RateLimitSettings`, `BoundsSettings`, `WebAuthnSettings`,
  `DatabasePoolSettings` and `WorkerSettings` each enforce their accepted
  register in `__post_init__`, from one runtime `PolicyBound` per field that the
  environment reader and the constructor both call. The accepted non-numeric
  shapes are enforced with them, N-21's one cross-field rule is enforced at the
  object owning both fields, and every seam that re-reads a settings value reads
  each attribute once and validates that read.

Evidence is TC-AUTH-19(m), TC-STRUCT-07 and TC-LIM-06; 587 portal and 2260 bot
tests with no skips; `alembic check` clean; the visual freeze intact; and two
recorded falsification runs in which 16 of 22 new session cases fail against the
reviewed `isinstance` predicate and 81 of 145 new settings cases fail against the
previous reader-only model, while every pre-existing test stays green — neither
existing suite contained a counterexample.

**Nothing is accepted by this remediation.** No accepted numeric value moved, no
configuration variable was added, renamed or removed, no schema or migration
changed, and no deployment value changed. **I-09 and I-10 both remain open**,
**P3.G1 remains open**, and **P3.2 and P3.3 have not started.** Stated residuals:
N-09/N-10 have no P3.1 route consumer and N-21/N-22 have no consumer at all;
`WEB_WEBAUTHN_USER_VERIFICATION` and `WEB_RECOVERY_GRANT_MINUTES` are validated
but read by no runtime consumer; the worker's lease/attempt consumers are P3.3's;
and no ordering relationship between N-23's lease and heartbeat is enforced,
because no accepted document states one — that is an open maintainer question,
not a decision taken in a constructor.

Deferred validation gap recorded 2026-08-15: RAID **I-10** now tracks five
public `WebSettings` sub-dataclasses whose accepted numeric and related policy is
enforced by the environment reader but not by their own construction boundaries:
`RateLimitSettings`, `BoundsSettings`, `WebAuthnSettings`,
`DatabasePoolSettings` and `WorkerSettings`. This is not reported as an
environment-string bypass and no implementation change is claimed. It is a
future scoped remediation with security priority for rate limits, web bounds and
WebAuthn, availability priority for the database pool, and a mandatory pre-P3.3
condition for worker bounds. The acceptance contract explicitly requires exact
built-in integers (`type(value) is int`), direct/`replace`/subclass and real
consumer tests, preservation of aggregated redacted environment errors, and
independent review. See
[`../review/phase-3-settings-construction-validation-gap.md`](../review/phase-3-settings-construction-validation-gap.md).

Update 2026-08-15 (fifth, later the same day) — appended, not rewritten. Codex's
independent re-review of the session-bounds-construction remediation returned
**one blocking counterexample**, reported from two perspectives: F1 in the
implementation review and S1 in the distinct security-focused pass. They describe
the same defect, and it is a defect of *where the rule is defined* rather than of
what the rule says.

- `SESSION_CEILINGS` gave both enforcement gates the same **bounds** and left each
  to state independently what a value of these fields may **be**.
  `SessionSettings.__post_init__` required an actual `int`, never a `bool`,
  positive and within its ceiling. The derived-policy gate restated the rule as
  the two ordering comparisons `value < 1` and `value > ceiling`, and dropped the
  type half.
- Two ordering comparisons are not a whole-number rule, because `float("nan")`
  makes both of them false. A non-finite `max_sessions_per_account` therefore
  survived `SessionPolicy.derive()`, and `len(live) >= maximum` in
  `_enforce_session_limit` was false for **every** live-session count — **N-66
  revoked nothing**, and the bound on how many stolen or forgotten session
  credentials can be live for one account was inoperative.
- The route was ordinary, not forgery: `derive()` accepts `SessionSettings`
  subclasses deliberately, so a subclass whose inherited `__post_init__` observes
  the valid stored integer can answer differently on the single later derivation
  read. No `object.__new__`, no mutation of a frozen instance, no forged
  `SessionPolicy` and no private helper was needed.

Remediated on 2026-08-15 in
`docs/review/phase-3-p3-1-od-44-session-policy-numeric-validation-remediation-submission.md`
with **one authoritative runtime definition** rather than a third restatement.
`session_policy_problem` / `session_policy_problems` sit beside `SESSION_CEILINGS`
in `application/web/config.py`, and both `SessionSettings.__post_init__` and
`_validate_policy_values` in `application/web/sessions.py` — the function
`SessionPolicy.__post_init__` and `SessionPolicy.derive()` both go through — call
them. The accepted type is an `int` and never a `bool`, which refuses floats as a
class: integral-looking, fractional, infinite and NaN alike, rather than naming
the one non-finite value a review happened to find. Evidence is TC-AUTH-19(l) and
the new TC-SESS-08b in `tests/web/test_session_policy_numeric_validation.py`, 420
portal tests and 2260 bot tests passing with no skips, `alembic check` clean, and
a **recorded falsification run**: with the reviewed two-comparison validator
restored in memory, nine of the new cases fail while the whole pre-existing
54-test session-lifetime suite stays green — the earlier suite contained no
counterexample.
**Nothing is accepted by this remediation.** It is submitted for a fresh
independent implementation re-review and a separately reported security-focused
re-review; **P3.G1 remains open, and P3.2 has not started.** I-09 is amended
rather than closed. No accepted numeric value moved, no configuration variable was
added or renamed, no schema or migration change was made, and no deployment value
changed. The stated residual is that the other `WebSettings` sub-dataclasses have
**not** been audited for the same divergent-gate shape.

Previous update 2026-08-15 (fourth, later the same day) — appended, not rewritten. Codex's
independent re-review of the idle-policy-construction remediation returned **three
blocking counterexamples**, and together they say that an extensible policy object
was the wrong authority boundary rather than one that needed another guard.

- **F1.** `SessionIdlePolicy.from_settings()` validated only positivity, and
  `SessionSettings` was a public frozen dataclass with no construction-time
  validation. `SessionSettings(..., emergency_idle_minutes=60, ...)` was therefore
  an accepted object, and the policy derived from it returned sixty minutes for
  both break-glass methods. Closing the policy's constructor achieved nothing
  while the numbers it read were unconstrained, and environment-reader validation
  cannot make invalid instances of a public settings type impossible.
- **F2.** The refresh statement was generated by iterating the policy's public,
  overridable `__iter__`. An ordinary subclass inherited the supported factory and
  replaced the SQL's mapping while `for_method()` went on reporting fifteen
  minutes; the reproduction bound `idle_seconds = 3600.0` for all three methods.
  This is ordinary Python subclassing, not forgery, and the previous submission
  was wrong to treat it as out of scope.
- **F3.** `SessionService.__init__()` accepted a repository *and* an independently
  supplied policy and never required them to be the same. Correct wiring at the
  two production sites was true and was not an invariant of the boundary.

Remediated on 2026-08-15 in
`docs/review/phase-3-p3-1-od-44-session-bounds-construction-remediation-submission.md`
by simplifying the construction model rather than adding guards.
**`SessionIdlePolicy` is deleted.** `SessionSettings` validates the accepted
numeric register in `__post_init__`, so an out-of-register instance cannot exist
however it was built (F1). `SessionRepository` **derives** a `SessionPolicy` from
settings, reading each configured number exactly once, and accepts no policy
object; the `CASE` branches are generated by walking `AuthMethod` and asking an
explicit classification table, so there is nothing to iterate and nothing to
subclass into the SQL (F2). `SessionService` reads its bounds from the repository
and has no policy argument, so a graph with two independently configured bounds
sources is not constructible (F3). An authentication method with no explicit
classification now refuses at import and at repository construction instead of
inheriting the shorter window by inference. Evidence is TC-AUTH-19(k), 392 portal
tests and 2260 bot tests passing with no skips, `alembic check` clean, and the
recorded before/after reproductions of all three counterexamples.
**Nothing is accepted by this remediation.** It is submitted for a fresh
independent implementation re-review and a separately reported security-focused
re-review; **P3.G1 remains open, and P3.2 has not started.** I-09 is amended
rather than closed. Reachability is unchanged and still stated plainly: no P3.1
HTTP route calls `touch()`, so this correction is proven at the service and
repository boundary and not in request handling. No schema change, no migration
edit, no configuration-variable rename and no deployment-value change was
involved.

Previous update 2026-08-15 (third, later the same day) — appended, not rewritten. Codex's
independent re-review of the session-touch policy remediation returned **one
blocking finding**, and it is the same authority in a third position rather than a
new defect. Removing `idle` and `expected_auth_method` from
`SessionRepository.touch()` had moved the method-to-duration pairing into
`SessionIdlePolicy`'s public dataclass constructor: the mapping that gives *every*
authentication method N-06's 60-minute window is complete, duplicate-free and
positive, so the constructor accepted it, and a repository built with it selected
60 minutes for persisted WebAuthn and recovery-grant rows — N-15's 15-minute idle
limit bypassed again, up to the 60-minute emergency absolute bound. The policy
tests proved completeness, uniqueness and positivity and never attempted a
complete but semantically false mapping, so the previous submission's claims that
no supported API could pair a method with another policy's duration, and that
policy was built once and injected, were both false. A related composition defect
was found with it: `WebComposition.services()` built one policy for the repository
while `SessionService.__init__()` built another from settings — equivalent in
production, but two derivations rather than one instance. Remediated on 2026-08-15
in
`docs/review/phase-3-p3-1-od-44-session-idle-policy-construction-remediation-submission.md`:
the policy has **no public constructor**, its one factory takes `SessionSettings`,
which methods receive the emergency window is classification derived inside it
from `AuthMethod.is_break_glass`, and one instance is built at the composition
root and injected into the repository *and* the service. `SessionSettings` remains
the sole numeric source and every pair of values its contract accepts — including
an ordinary window shorter than the emergency one — maps by classification.
Evidence is TC-AUTH-19(j), 16 killed mutants with byte-identical restoration
verified by digest, 381 portal tests and 2260 bot tests passing with no skips.
**Nothing is accepted by this remediation.** It is submitted for a new Codex
independent implementation re-review and a separately reported security-focused
re-review; **P3.G1 remains open, and P3.2 has not started.** I-09 is amended
rather than closed. Reachability is unchanged and still stated plainly: no P3.1
HTTP route calls `touch()`, so this correction is proven at the service and
repository boundary and not in request handling — it is required now because P3.2
is intended to consume this API. No schema change, no migration edit and no
configuration change was involved.

Previous update 2026-08-15 (second, later the same day) — appended, not rewritten. Codex's
independent implementation and security re-reviews of the session-lifetime
remediation returned **one blocking finding**: the break-glass idle-policy
correction had been made in `SessionService` only. `SessionRepository.touch()`
still accepted `idle` and `expected_auth_method` as independent arguments and
verified only that the method matched the row, so a caller supplying a
break-glass session's **correct** method beside N-06's 60-minute duration matched
and extended that session's idle window to its absolute bound — N-15's 15 minutes
bypassed through the supported lower-level API, with every stated check passing.
The repository test offered as proof supplied a *mismatched* method and never
exercised that pairing; it has been replaced, not retained. Remediated on
2026-08-15 in
`docs/review/phase-3-p3-1-od-44-session-touch-policy-remediation-submission.md`:
the refresh duration is no longer a parameter at any layer, being selected inside
the atomic `UPDATE` by `CASE auth_method` from an immutable validated
`SessionIdlePolicy` built from configuration and injected once at the composition
root. Evidence is the rewritten TC-AUTH-19, 13 killed mutants with byte-identical
restoration verified by digest, 362 portal tests and 2260 bot tests passing with
no skips. **Nothing is accepted by this remediation.** It is submitted for a new
Codex independent implementation re-review and a separately reported
security-focused re-review; **P3.G1 remains open, and P3.2 has not started.**
I-09 is amended rather than closed. Reachability is unchanged and still stated
plainly: no P3.1 HTTP route calls `touch()`, so this correction is proven at the
service and repository boundary and not in request handling — it is required now
because P3.2 is intended to consume this API.

Previous update 2026-08-15 — appended, not rewritten. Codex's independent re-review of the
provider-binding and rotation-integrity remediation returned **two further
blocking findings**, both in the session idle refresh: `touch()` could revive an
idle-expired session from a stale record, and it gave WebAuthn and recovery-grant
sessions N-06's 60-minute idle window instead of N-15's 15-minute one. A refused
refresh was additionally reported as success. Both are remediated on 2026-08-15
(`docs/review/phase-3-p3-1-od-44-session-lifetime-remediation-submission.md`)
together with the documentation the rotation-lifetime correction left
outstanding: liveness is now enforced inside each conditional write, neither
continuation writes `absolute_expires_at`, the idle duration follows the persisted
authentication method, and both refusals are typed. Evidence is TC-AUTH-18 and
TC-AUTH-19, nine killed mutants with byte-identical restoration, 354 portal tests
and 2260 bot tests passing with no skips. **Nothing is accepted by this
remediation.** It is submitted for a new Codex independent implementation
re-review and a separately reported security-focused re-review; **P3.G1 remains
open, and P3.2 has not started.** New issue **I-09** tracks it. Note for the
reader: no P3.1 HTTP route calls `touch()`, so that half of the correction is
proven at the service and repository boundary and not in request handling.

Previous status date: 2026-08-14 (I-07 and I-08 ruled; OD-44 implemented, re-reviewed by Codex, and remediated again for provider binding and rotation integrity; P3.G1 open)

Baseline: v1.5; accepted by Peter Duscha on 2026-08-02

Overall health: Amber — Phases 0–2, the frontend visual-design track, Phase 3
readiness and P3.0 are accepted. P3.G0 is closed. **P3.1 was implemented,
reviewed by Codex, and partly remediated; it is not accepted.** The disposable
PostgreSQL prerequisite was confirmed on 2026-08-14 and the package's database
evidence was executed against it. Codex returned three blocking findings and one
important finding; two are remediated and Peter has now ruled **I-07** and
**I-08**. The OD-44 durable completion binding is now **implemented** as
migration 0009, with real-PostgreSQL concurrency, constraint, rollback and
mutation evidence, and is resubmitted. Codex's independent and security re-reviews
of that package returned two further blocking items — the completion claim did not
bind the transaction's recorded **provider**, and the partial unique index Peter
approved needed rotation integrity behind it — and both are now remediated in the
same revision 0009 and the OAuth, session and provider boundaries, with
TC-AUTH-15/16/17 and six killed mutations. P3.G1 now requires a Codex independent
implementation re-review plus a distinct security-focused pass before P3.2 may
start. Staging does not exist, so
every staging-class check in the traceability contract remains unrun. Gemini
production integration remains blocked.

## Decisions ruled on 2026-08-14

Peter ruled I-07/OD-44 and I-08/OD-45; the completion binding is implemented and awaits re-review. The deferred HTTP evidence is a named P3.G2 blocker. See `docs/review/phase-3-p3-1-submission.md` and `docs/review/phase-3-p3-1-remediation-submission.md`. Gemini production integration remains blocked until its later contract gate. |

## Current critical path

1. **P3.0 contract/security design package — delivered 2026-08-13.** Produced
   from `docs/review/phase-3-p3-0-claude-prompt.md`. It adds no protected route
   and no framework scaffold. Five proposals need Peter's decision: a separate
   `freedom-worker` service, the tighter break-glass route boundary, apply-as-a
   -durable-job, the P3.0-proposed numeric values, and ADR 0010.
2. **P3.G1 — the current blocker, with both decisions now ruled.** P3.1 was
   delivered on 2026-08-14 from `docs/review/phase-3-p3-1-claude-prompt.md`,
   against a confirmed guarded disposable PostgreSQL database, and reviewed by
   Codex the same day. Two findings were remediated — the incomplete OAuth
   refusal auditing and the inaccurate migration reporting — and are recorded in
   `docs/review/phase-3-p3-1-remediation-submission.md`. Peter approved the
   durable one-way completion binding (OD-44) and moved only the unavailable
   HTTP evidence to P3.G2 (OD-45). The completion binding **was implemented on
   2026-08-14** as migration 0009 with the required concurrency, constraint,
   rollback and mutation evidence, recorded in
   `docs/review/phase-3-p3-1-od-44-remediation-submission.md`.
   A further Codex independent
   implementation review and a **separately reported** security-focused pass are
   required before P3.2 starts. Three items are carried into that review as
   declared deviations rather than as silent choices: the nullable
   `role_capability_mappings.created_by_account_id` for the migration-inserted
   protected row, the added `WEB_SECRET_KEY_CLIENT_DIGEST`, and the added
   `webauthn_challenges` table.
3. **Coordinated implementation.** Claude owns the backend foundation;
   Gemini owns production Jinja/static/HTMX integration only against accepted
   route/view-model contracts; Codex supplies independent and separate
   security-focused review recommendations. Peter records gate decisions.
4. **Backend contract package.** Authentication and server-side authorization
   precede every protected route. The measured 9.57-second, 32-Actor preview
   requires a durable asynchronous/progressive design rather than a synchronous
   HTTP handler or restart-unsafe in-memory queue.
5. **Stop at the contract/security review.** Gemini production integration does
   not begin until Claude's route/view-model contracts are stable and accepted.

## Closed readiness inputs

- Project reconciliation and accepted visual baseline commit: completed
  2026-08-13 without production implementation.
- Phase 2 gate: accepted 2026-08-12.
- OD-16 and OD-17: closed 2026-08-12.
- Backend/frontend/review delivery-agent allocation: Claude/Gemini/Codex.
- §12.1 visual direction: accepted 2026-08-13.
- Visual implementation freeze: 14/14 manifest entries verified.
- Static evidence tools on 2026-08-13: CSS tokens 71 defined, 62 referenced,
  zero undefined; contrast self-tests 11 passed; contrast matrix 49 pairs, 48
  passed, one disabled-state exemption, zero failures.

## Open Phase 3 conditions

- maintainer/reviewer availability windows before calendar forecasting;
- confirmed development, disposable PostgreSQL and staging environments — the
  disposable database was **confirmed on 2026-08-14** (`freedom_test`, reached
  over the local Unix-domain socket, proven through the repository's own
  `assert_disposable_target` / `verify_connected_unix_socket_target` guards) and
  the separate `freedom-web` virtualenv now exists; **staging still does not**,
  so every staging-class check in the traceability contract is unrun;
- expansion of the accepted traceability categories to exact implemented tests
  and evidence during each implementation handoff;
- accepted backend route/view-model contracts before production frontend work —
  accepted at P3.G0, with the later P3.G2/P3.G3 freeze gates still required;
- implementation and verification of the accepted configuration, deployment,
  monitoring and rollback contracts for the new `freedom-web` process; and
- two quantities remain unmeasured and block no P3.0 acceptance but must be
  measured before production: real-folder apply duration and worker peak memory.

## Scope controls

- `design-prototype/` remains static reference material and must not be imported
  or served by production code.
- Phase 3 remains read-only for character game state. Council character-link
  management and snapshot-import control are authorized administrative flows;
  generic character corrections and controlled-vocabulary editors remain with
  their owning later typed packages.
- The former Claude contrast-tooling prompt is superseded without execution. It
  is not a backend implementation prompt.
- No deployment, Caddy change, OAuth registration, production database change,
  Foundry mutation or Google Sheet mutation is authorized by reconciliation.

## Historical evidence

The detailed Phase 2 remediation chronology remains in the dated records under
`docs/review/`, `docs/operations/` and `docs/project-management/change-log.md`.
This current-status document intentionally does not repeat superseded open-gate
statements; Git history retains the earlier status narrative.

## Next status update

The OD-44 provider-binding and rotation-integrity remediation was submitted on
2026-08-14, after the completion-binding remediation earlier the same day. Update
again when Peter records the P3.G1 decision after the further Codex independent
review and the distinct security-focused pass — or earlier if a new decision, critical risk or
environment constraint emerges.
